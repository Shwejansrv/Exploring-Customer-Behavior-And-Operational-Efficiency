# Customer Data Analysis with Hive and Trino on AWS EMR and EC2

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of a large customer dataset using AWS EMR and EC2. The primary goal is to compare the performance of two prominent big data processing tools, Hive and Trino, in extracting meaningful insights from the data.

### Dataset
The dataset contains diverse customer information, including demographics and purchase history. It is stored in a distributed manner, requiring advanced processing techniques for comprehensive analysis.

### Tools and Technologies
AWS EMR: Utilized for scalable and distributed data processing.
AWS EC2: Ensured elastic compute capacity to handle dynamic processing demands.
Hive: Used as a data warehousing solution, executing SQL-like queries and performing data manipulation tasks.
Trino (Presto): Employed for real-time SQL queries, enabling interactive analysis across multiple data sources.

### Implementation
Hive
Applied HiveQL queries for data aggregation, filtering, and transformation.
Derived insights into customer behavior and preferences through SQL-like queries.
Trino
